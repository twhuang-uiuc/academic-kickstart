# Abstract.
abstract = "In this paper we present DtCraft, a distributed execution engine that enables a new powerful programming model to streamline cluster computing. Applications are described in a set of data-parallel streams, leaving difficult execution details and concurrency controls handled by our system kernel transparently. Compared with existing systems, DtCraft is unique in (1) an efficient stream- oriented programming paradigm using modern C++17, (2) an in-context resource controller and task executor based on Linux container technology, and (3) ease of development from prototyping machines to production cloud environments. These capabilities power industry applications and create new research directions in machine learning, stream processing, and distributed multimedia systems."
